# Lab 01: Basic LAN Connectivity

## Objective
Create a simple LAN using a switch and verify communication between two PCs.

## Topology

## IP Addressing

| Device | IP Address |
|------|------------|
| PC1  | 192.168.1.10 |
| PC2  | 192.168.1.11 |

## Configuration Steps
1. Added two PCs and one switch
2. Connected devices using straight-through cables
3. Assigned IP addresses manually

## Verification
- Successful ping between PC1 and PC2

## Lessons Learned
- Switches forward frames using MAC addresses
- Devices in the same subnet communicate without a router
